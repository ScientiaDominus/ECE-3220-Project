# ECE-3220-Project
This is the project used for my ECE-3220 software designs class. This project contains a program that allows the user to create a Dungeon and Dragon's character as well as edit the character stats, attributes, and spells. The program will automatically calculate the skill totals etc. 

Currently the project members are Cameron Young: cky39v
